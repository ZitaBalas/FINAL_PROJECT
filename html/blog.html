                <h2>Traveling with a dog – How to teach a dog to stay in a tent?</h2>

                <p>The chapter itself is getting the dog used to the tent. If the dog has no experience sleeping in a tent, then it is not a completely good idea to go to the camp right away and just risk it. You could easily be expelled from the campsite for disturbing the night’s peace. Not everyone has an understanding for the intense night barking of a dog in a tent.</p>

                <p>I recommend first training everything in peace at home, in the cottage, with friends in the garden, etc. Unpack the tent, play with the dog around the tent, play with the dog in the tent, feed him in the tent. Try to sleep with him for a few nights and when you are sure that the dog can handle it in peace, you can go out into the world.</p>

                <h2>Akita Inu training camp</h2>
                <p>Taki and I took part in the Akita Inu training camp in Nová Živohošť near the Slapy reservoir. It was already the 13th year of the Akita camp. The organizers Veronika and Michaela accompanied us throughout the program and we learned from them the maximum of practical and theoretical information about the training, care and behavior of dogs. We only participated in the first tour for beginners, but next time we will definitely take part in the advanced section.</p>

                <p>For Bandi, as a 5 month old puppy Akita Inu, the whole camp was challenging, but maximally useful.</p>

                <p>We were accommodated in Juniorcamp Nová Živohošť and we highly recommend this accommodation. It is especially suitable for accommodation with a dog, who can also go to the restaurant.</p>

                <h2>Is the Akita Inu a sporty dog?</h2>

                <p>If nap is a recognized sport, then yes, the Akita Inu excels in this field!</p>

                <p>It a breed of Japanese dogs that are not usually very active. They do not have the morphology for traction sports or jumps (which are strongly not recommended anyway). But if you adapt to your dog, your dog likes the activity and you take all the necessary precautions, why not.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, Akita Inu can be perfect companions for walks and hikes (once their growth is over). I personally love to walk my Akita or go on hikes. Of course at their pace… Especially Bandita’s! It teaches us to enjoy every moment of walking, to observe and listen to the nature around us. I love being alone in the world with them for hours.</p>

                <p>The Akita Inu is therefore a perfect companion for a walk, when he decides that a break in his nap is necessary!</p>

                <h2>A trip with a dog to the ruins of the Okoř castle</h2>

                <p>With our Taki, Akita Inu puppy, she is now 5 months old, we went on a trip to the ruins of Okoř Castle, which is located near Prague (Capital City od Czech republic). It is perhaps the only castle that is built in the valley and can be seen up close.</p>

                <p>2 hours of time will be enough for a tour and a walk around Okora. During the walk, the dog may cool down in a stream that has an abnormally shallow bank.</p>

                <p>The “Okoř se šťávou” a “Festival Okoř” festivals are traditionally held in the vicinity of the Okoř Castle (directly below the castle). The atmosphere of these events is really unreal in the area in front of the castle and I recommend experiencing it. During the year, you can come across various performances of swordsmen and narrative battles.</p>

                <p>In the vicinity of the castle it is forbidden to let the dog without a leash, but even on a leash you can enjoy the dog and the trip!</p>

                <h2>People say Akita Inu can be a bit stubborn, is that true?</h2>

                <p>Akita Inu are not the kind of breed that will listen and accept anything. You will often hear people say it can be a <q>>stubborn</q> Japanese dog. I would rather say that it is a <q>decision-making</q> Japanese dog who knows what he wants, when he wants it, and how to get it… He knows how to make himself understood! This is something I particularly like about Akita. With him you have to be patient and find the right motivation.</p>

                <p>Bandi excels in this aspect: his life is slow-paced! When you ask him something, you can picture what he thinks and you laugh at it. For example:</p>

                <p><q>Come back to my owner? Do I really feel like it? If I get up and go, is it really worth it? Does this justify the energy I will have to spend, or do I have better things to do before I go?</q> With an attitude that gives the impression that life is so difficult! You really have to go all in to motivate him!</p>

                <h2>Can you walk your Akita Inu off-leash?</h2>

                <p>What you should know is that it is often difficult, at a certain age, to walk your Akita Inu without any leash, mostly because of the sensitive side I mentioned earlier with the other dogs. That said, the instinct for the hunt is very much awake in this breed. If my Akita Inu has decided to follow a track, he will go, and will return only once that instinct is satisfied. This instinct manifests differently in each dog: my American Akita is a very big hunter, while Bandita goes off in his own little world.</p>

                <p>The Akita Inu can be very receptive to its owner while walking in one moment, and in the next it can suddenly decide otherwise and stop listening to any instruction in pursuit of whatever thing has its interest… This means calling your dog back is not always successful. That’s why we often recommend holding your Akita Inu on a leash.</p>
