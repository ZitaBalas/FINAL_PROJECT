        <h1>How to train your akita</h1>

        <p>Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very
            powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently, beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive
            guardians, so it's especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They
            must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their
            independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be
            aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine
            interactions.</p>

            <h2>Early socialization</h2>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>Give your Akita regular physical contact as soon as he is separated from his mother and litter. This
                should happen no sooner than six weeks after birth. Stroke him, give him toys and get him used to human
                contact. If he nips at you, mimic the response of his litter mates and give a high pitched “yelp.” This
                is how puppies tell each other off when things get too rough. It’s important to discourage this behavior
                early, as uncorrected nipping in a protective, powerful breed like the Akita can lead to big problems
                later on.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>

            <p>Walk him around the house and yard on a long leash. Let him explore but use the leash to keep his
                movement in check. If he tries to pull away, gently restrain him and say “heel.” Akitas are naturally
                very bold, so get him into the habit of walking by your side from an early age.</p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>

            <p>Introduce your Akita to family and friends while he is still very young. Encourage others to play with
                him so he becomes accustomed to being touched. Tell the kids not to play chase with the Akita. The breed
                has a strong prey drive, so this sort of behavior will stimulate his hunting instinct.</p>

            <h2>Basic Obedience</h2>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>Hold a biscuit in front of his face. Move it so it passes over his nose, behind his head. Say “sit” as
                you do this. As he follows the treat, he’ll eventually park his bottom on the floor to get a better
                look.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>

            <p>Release the treat as soon as he sits.</p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>

            <p>Give verbal praise and physical fuss to reward the action. With plenty of repetition, your Akita will
                learn that the sitting action has a positive outcome and will eventually do so on command without the
                need for a treat. Use the same principles to teach the “down” command, but instead of moving the treat
                over his head, move it from his nose toward the ground. The sit and down commands are very useful for
                keeping unwanted behavior in check.</p>

            <h2>Out And About</h2>

            <h3>Step 1</h3>

            <p>Go for regular walks, but always leash your Akita. Exercise is essential for this high-energy breed, as
                it relieves boredom. It also enables him to learn manners when around new people and dogs.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>

            <p>Give verbal praise intermittently for as long as he walks politely by your side. Correct any
                misdemeanors, such as pulling and barking at other dogs or people by changing your walking direction and
                removing the praise. Use the leash to gently guide him if necessary. This distracts the dog from his
                previous action.</p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>

            <p>Issue the sit command directly after distracting him.</p>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>

            <p>Issue the down command, then give him verbal praise. This shows him that you’re in charge, an important
                lesson to learn for these strong-willed dogs.</p>
