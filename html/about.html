            <p>
                There is a debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita. As of 2020, the
                American
                Kennel Club, now consider American and Japanese Akitas to be two separate breeds, no longer allowing
                free breeding between the two. The issue is especially controversial in Japan.
                The Japanese strain comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of
                the breed, while the
                American strain comes in all dog colors.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <div>
                <p>The dog breed, Akita, originated in the snowy and rural lands of Odate, Akita Prefecture, a
                    mountainous
                    region of Japan. They were trained to hunt animals such as elk, wild boar, and Ussuri brown bears.
                    This
                    breed in the 1600s was involved in dog fighting, which at the time was popular in Japan. From the
                    1500s
                    into the 1800s, the Akita served as companions for samurai.</p>

                <h3>In the early 20th Century</h3>

                <p>During the early 20th century the Akita was in decline, as a result of being cross bred with the
                    German
                    Shepherd Dog, St. Bernard, Mastiff. As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz
                    characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (
                    color other than red), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi
                    (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu
                    to restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have
                    relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the
                    breed
                    took place.</p>

                <h3>During World War II</h3>

                <p>The Akita were used during the Russo-Japanese War to track prisoners of war and lost sailors. During
                    World War II the Akita was also crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the
                    wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled. Some were used as scouts and guards
                    during the war. The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita,
                    a
                    form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show
                    competition.

            <div>
                <p>As a spitz breed, the appearance of the Akita reflects cold weather adaptations essential to their
                    original function. The Akita is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones. Characteristic
                    physical traits of the breed include a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a
                    slight
                    angle following the arch of the neck. Additionally, the eyes of the Akita are small, dark, deeply
                    set
                    and triangular in shape. Akitas have thick double coats, and tight, well knuckled cat-like feet.
                    Their
                    tails are carried over the top of the back in a gentle or double curl down the loin.</p>

                <h3>Weight</h3>

                <p>Mature American type males measure typically 66–71 cm at the withers and weigh between 45–59 kg.
                    Mature
                    females typically measure 61–66 cm and weigh between 32–45 kg. The Japanese type, as stated in the
                    breed
                    standards, are a little smaller and lighter.</p>

                <h3>Color types</h3>

                <p>Breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors are allowable in the American Akita, including
                    pinto, all types of brindle, solid white, black mask, white mask, self-colored mask, even differing
                    colors of under coat and overlay (guard hairs). This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern
                    known as Urajiro. The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn,
                    sesame,
                    brindle, pure white, all with Urajiro markings whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle, on the
                    cheeks,
                    on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body and tail and on the inside of the legs.</p>

                <h3>Coat types</h3>

                <p>There are two coat types in the Akita, the standard coat length and the long coat. The long coat is
                    considered a fault in the show ring, however. The long coat, also known as Moku is the result of an
                    autosomal recessive gene and may only occur phenotypically if both sire and dam are carriers. They
                    have
                    longer (about 7 to 10 cm in length) and softer coats and are known to have sweeter temperaments. It
                    is
                    believed that this gene comes from the now extinct Karafuto-Ken Samurai dog.</p>

                <h3>Grooming needs</h3>

                <p>American Akitas are a low maintenance dog breed. They actually tend to groom themselves like a cat.
                    Grooming them should be an easy process. They are fairly heavy shedders and can go heavier than
                    normal
                    two to three times per year. Specifically, Akitas "blow out" their coats twice a year. Daily
                    brushing
                    could be a good way to reduce this problem. This breed needs to bathe every few months, although it
                    can
                    be more often, depending on the needs of each owner. Toenails should be trimmed every month, and
                    their
                    ears should be cleaned once a week.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Akita is generally seen as territorial about its property, and can be reserved with strangers. It
                    is
                    sometimes described as feline in its actions; it is not unusual for an Akita to clean its face after
                    eating, to preen its kennel mate, and to be fastidious in the house. They are known to be intolerant
                    of
                    other dogs of the same sex, as stated in the AKC breed standard.</p>

                <h3>Temperament</h3>

                <p>Since it is a large, powerful dog, the Akita is not considered a breed for a first time dog owner.
                    The
                    breed has been targeted by some countries' breed-specific legislation as a dangerous dog. The Akita
                    is a
                    large, strong, independent and dominant dog. A well-trained Akita should be accepting of
                    non-threatening
                    strangers, otherwise they will treat all strangers in an aggressive manner. As a breed they should
                    be
                    good with children; it is said that the breed has an affinity for children. Not all Akitas will
                    necessarily have the same temperament.</p><br><br><br>

                <h3>Behaviour with other dogs</h3>

                <p>Akitas tend to be reactive towards other dogs, and thus caution must be used in situations when
                    Akitas
                    are likely to be around other dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In particular, Akitas tend to be
                    less
                    tolerant of dogs of the same sex. For this reason, Akitas, unless highly socialized, are not
                    generally
                    well-suited for off-leash dog parks. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a confident, consistent
                    handler,
                    without which the dog will be very wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals.
