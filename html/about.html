        <h1>What you should better know about Akita</h1>

        <p>The Akita is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous regions of northern Japan. There are two
            separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called Akita Inu (inu means dog in Japanese) or
            Japanese Akita, and an American strain, known as the Akita or American Akita. The Japanese strain comes
            in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American
            strain comes in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern
            spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can also be found in many litters due to a
            recessive gene.</p>

            <h2>Breed</h2>

            <p>There is a debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita. As of 2020, the American
                Kennel Club, now consider American and Japanese Akitas to be two separate breeds, no longer allowing
                free breeding between the two. Some countries refer to the American Akita as simply the Akita and not
                the American Akita. The issue is especially controversial in Japan.</p>
        </article>

        <article id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>The dog breed, Akita, originated in the snowy and rural lands of Odate, Akita Prefecture, a mountainous
                region of Japan. They were trained to hunt animals such as elk, wild boar, and Ussuri brown bears. This
                breed in the 1600s was involved in dog fighting, which at the time was popular in Japan. From the 1500s
                into the 1800s, the Akita served as companions for samurai.</p>

            <p>During the early 20th century the Akita was in decline, as a result of being cross bred with the German
                Shepherd Dog, St. Bernard, Mastiff. As a result, a lot of specimens started to lose their spitz
                characteristics and instead took on drop ears, straight tails, non-Japanese color (black masks, and any
                color other than red, white or brindle), and loose skin. A native Japanese breed known as Matagi
                (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita Inu to
                bring back the spitz phenotype and restore the Akita breed. The modern day Japanese Akita have
                relatively few genes from western dogs and are spitz in phenotype after the reconstruction of the breed
                took place, however the larger American breed of Akita largely descends from the mixed Akita before the
                restoration of the breed, and thus American Akita are typically mixed and not considered true Akita by
                the Japanese standard.</p>

            <p>The Akita were used during the Russo-Japanese War to track prisoners of war and lost sailors. During
                World War II the Akita was also crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the
                wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled. Some were used as scouts and guards
                during the war. The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a
                form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.
            </p>

            <p>The story of Hachikō, the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international
                dog world. Hachikō was born in 1923 and owned by Professor Hidesaburō Ueno of Tokyo. Professor Ueno
                lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a suburb of the city and commuted to work every day on the
                train. Hachikō accompanied his master to and from the station each day. On May 25, 1925, when the dog
                was 18 months old, he waited for his master's arrival on the four o'clock train, but Professor Ueno had
                had a fatal brain haemorrhage at work. Hachikō continued to wait for his master's return. He travelled
                to and from the station each day for the next nine years. He allowed the professor's relatives to care
                for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master. His vigil became world-renowned
                when, in 1934, shortly before his death, a bronze statue was erected at the Shibuya train station in his
                honor. This statue was melted down for munitions during the war, but a new one was commissioned after
                the war. Each year on April 8 since 1936, Hachikō's devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of
                remembrance at Tokyo's Shibuya railroad station. Eventually, Hachikō's legendary faithfulness became a
                national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of the Emperor.</p>

        <article id="appereance">
            <h2>Appereance</h2>
            <p>As a spitz breed, the appearance of the Akita reflects cold weather adaptations essential to their
                original function. The Akita is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones. Characteristic
                physical traits of the breed include a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a slight
                angle following the arch of the neck. Additionally, the eyes of the Akita are small, dark, deeply set
                and triangular in shape. Akitas have thick double coats, and tight, well knuckled cat-like feet. Their
                tails are carried over the top of the back in a gentle or double curl down the loin.</p>

            <p>Mature American type males measure typically 66–71 cm at the withers and weigh between 45–59 kg. Mature
                females typically measure 61–66 cm and weigh between 32–45 kg. The Japanese type, as stated in the breed
                standards, are a little smaller and lighter.</p>

            <p>Breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors are allowable in the American Akita, including
                pinto, all types of brindle, solid white, black mask, white mask, self-colored mask, even differing
                colors of under coat and overlay (guard hairs). This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern
                known as Urajiro. The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn, sesame,
                brindle, pure white, all with Urajiro markings whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks,
                on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body and tail and on the inside of the legs.</p>

            <h3>Coat types</h3>

            <p>There are two coat types in the Akita, the standard coat length and the long coat. The long coat is
                considered a fault in the show ring, however. The long coat, also known as Moku is the result of an
                autosomal recessive gene and may only occur phenotypically if both sire and dam are carriers. They have
                longer (about 7 to 10 cm in length) and softer coats and are known to have sweeter temperaments. It is
                believed that this gene comes from the now extinct Karafuto-Ken Samurai dog.</p>

            <h3>Grooming needs</h3>

            <p>American Akitas are a low maintenance dog breed. They actually tend to groom themselves like a cat.
                Grooming them should be an easy process. They are fairly heavy shedders and can go heavier than normal
                two to three times per year. Specifically, Akitas "blow out" their coats twice a year. Daily brushing
                could be a good way to reduce this problem. This breed needs to bathe every few months, although it can
                be more often, depending on the needs of each owner. Toenails should be trimmed every month, and their
                ears should be cleaned once a week.</p>

        <article id="characteristics">
            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>The Akita is generally seen as territorial about its property, and can be reserved with strangers. It is
                sometimes described as feline in its actions; it is not unusual for an Akita to clean its face after
                eating, to preen its kennel mate, and to be fastidious in the house. They are known to be intolerant of
                other dogs of the same sex, as stated in the AKC breed standard.</p>

            <p>Since it is a large, powerful dog, the Akita is not considered a breed for a first time dog owner. The
                breed has been targeted by some countries' breed-specific legislation as a dangerous dog. The Akita is a
                large, strong, independent and dominant dog. A well-trained Akita should be accepting of non-threatening
                strangers, otherwise they will treat all strangers in an aggressive manner. As a breed they should be
                good with children; it is said that the breed has an affinity for children. Not all Akitas will
                necessarily have the same temperament.</p>

            <p>Akitas tend to be reactive towards other dogs, and thus caution must be used in situations when Akitas
                are likely to be around other dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In particular, Akitas tend to be less
                tolerant of dogs of the same sex. For this reason, Akitas, unless highly socialized, are not generally
                well-suited for off-leash dog parks. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a confident, consistent handler,
                without which the dog will be very wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals.</p>
